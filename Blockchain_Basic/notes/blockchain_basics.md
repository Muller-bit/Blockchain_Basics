- Sepolia , linea sepolia --> for testnet

### sending transaction on testnet

- Tenderly testnet(virtual testnet) - add the network prefix inaddition to Eth chain_Id and then we can get test fund from Tinderly
- We can test also sending walet to wallet trasfer between accounts
- tinderly prefix (1)

### Note on testnet - people run the node voluntarly keep in mind

### Introduction to Gas

- Gas is the amount of computational power used to process our transaction.
