### Blockchain Architecture Overview

- Consesus problem - come to an an aggreement
- Sybil attacks - many nodes weight or creating psedoanonymous account on to the blockchain
- Sybill Ressistance Mechanism(Pows and Pos )-> stake ETH meight be slashed if the nodes mis behave
- Finality - the txn confirmed by the node can not be reverted unlike bank txn
- After 6 blocks confirm added the probability of reversing it is minimum
- Rewriting all the transaction history consume to much power

### What is Hash and SHA256 algorithm?

- A unique fixed length of string used to identify a piece if data
- Block , nonce , Data and finally Hash for the inserted data
- Bruteforce - miners trying to solve the the nonce number which give the hash number starting with four zeros at the beggining of the hash.
- Genesis block - the first block in the blockchain , mostly it has all the zeros in the hash number .
- Fork - blockchain splits - longest chain rule
- Meme pool - is place where all the transaction lives there before added to the blockchain
- Signature - signing txn with a key
- Cryptographic key -
- Private key
- Public key
